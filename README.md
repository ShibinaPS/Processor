# Processor
Central processing unit. The project is about writing your own processor. The main stages of writing the project are: splitting the source code of the program written in assembler x86 into tokens, its subsequent lexical and semantic analysis and as a result of the work - checking the processor for the Factorial, Fibonacci, quadratic equation tests written in the assembler language x86.
